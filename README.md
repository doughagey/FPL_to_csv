FPL_to_csv

This python project scrapes the Fantasy Premier League website for player data and converts the most relevant/important stats into two separate csv files (one for player info, another for upcoming fixture difficulties) for use with other applications such as Tableau or Excel. No FPL account is required. Simply run the python script in the package directory and two csv files will be created in the same directory as the python file. For data visualization tools just do a join on the player ID. I kept them as separate csv files in case people did care about the fixture info.
