FPL_to_csv

This python project scrapes the Fantasy Premier League website for player data and converts the most relevant/important stats into a csv file for use with other applications such as Tableau. No FPL account is required. Simply run the python script in the package directory and a csv file will be created in the same directory as the python file.
